# rta

Super simple script that converts roman numbers to arabic numbers.

## How to use?

At first you need to call `npm install` in the project's main directory so all required node modules get installed.

Sample calls:

```
node rta -i MCMLVI
```

Script output:

```
input: MCMLVI
output: 1956

```
